# Application Setup Guide

This document outlines the steps required to set up and run the Rails application.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Ruby version:** [Insert Ruby version, e.g., 3.1.2]  
  Install using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

- **Rails version:** [Insert Rails version, e.g., 7.0.6]  
  Installed with: `gem install rails`

- **Database:** [Insert database, e.g., PostgreSQL]  
  Ensure the database server is installed and running.

- **Node.js:** Required for compiling JavaScript assets. Install from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

- **Yarn:** Required for managing JavaScript dependencies. Install using:  
  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

## Setting Up the Application

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Run the following commands to install required Ruby and JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file and add any necessary environment variables. Use the provided `.env.example` as a reference:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Setup the database**:  
   Run the following commands to create and initialize the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:seed # If seed data is available
   ```

5. **Precompile assets (optional for production)**:  
   ```bash
   rails assets:precompile
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the application:

1. **Development environment**:  
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```
   Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **Testing environment**:  
   Run the test suite with:
   ```bash
   rails test
   ```
   or if using RSpec:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec
   ```

3. **Production environment**:  
   Ensure all assets are precompiled and the database is migrated before starting the server:
   ```bash
   RAILS_ENV=production rails db:migrate
   RAILS_ENV=production rails assets:precompile
   rails server -e production
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Bundle errors**:  
   Ensure the correct Ruby version is being used and run `bundle install` again.

2. **Database errors**:  
   Verify the database service is running and the credentials are correctly set in `config/database.yml`.

3. **Missing environment variables**:  
   Check the `.env` file or production environment variable setup.
